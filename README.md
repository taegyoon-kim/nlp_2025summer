## Time and location

- Time: 9:30-12:00pm (Lecture I) & 2:00-4:30pm (Lecture II), July 30
- Location: 025 Yeonhui Hall, Yonsei University (연세대학교 연희관 025호)


## Overview

This workshop, titled "Text-as-Data" (or "텍스트 분석"), introduces social science students to a key subset of essential concepts and techniques in text-as-data.  
- The workshop will blend theoretical understanding with practical, hands-on experience.
- The workshop consists of two lectures (2.5 hours each cover two sessions). 
- The first two sessions will focus on pre-processing and representing texts, covering text normalization, vector semantics models, static and contextual word embeddings, and similarity measures.
- The next two sessions are more application-focused, discussing the use of contextual embeddings for topic modeling and generative models for text classification.

**Note that the workshop is intended as a broad introduction to text-as-data and NLP for social science research. For a more comprehensive, semester-length course, please refer to [NLP for Humanities and Social Sciences](https://github.com/taegyoon-kim/nlp_25spring).**


## Tutorials

The workshop will invovle guided coding (or tutorials) using Python and Google Colab. Little prior experience in the language is assumed. Note that students are expected to **bring their own computing device**.
